Wordle

A terminal-based implementation of the popular word game, WORDLE, written in C++.


Disclamer if you change the .txt file's name or extention the game will not work.

Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/tIcE420/vjezbe-oop/

2. Navgate to the project directory

3.Compile the source code using the following command:
g++ -o wordle main.cpp

Note:
Along with the game there is a words.txt file which is filled with 214 5 letter words.
You can add as many of your words as you want to the file since I used a vector of strings in the game implementation.
The words are not case sensitive as long as you enter the correct length the programme will run.
